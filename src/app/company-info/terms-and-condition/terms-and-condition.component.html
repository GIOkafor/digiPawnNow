				<p>
					The valuations and US dollar prices that you receive from our website are only valid for 10 days after you place your order.

				</p>

				<p>
					For cell phones and electronics, the quoted US Dollar (USD) price(s) you receive through the website are valid for 10 days. If we don’t receive your item(s) within 10 days of you receiving your US Dollar (USD) price quote, then, we may choose to revalue your item(s). The quoted Bitcoin, Ethereum (Ether) and Litecoin price(s)/amount(s) that you receive through the website are estimates based off of the current US dollar-to-cryptocurrency conversion rates the day you look up how much we are willing to pay you for your item(s) in US dollars. The quoted Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin price(s)/amount(s) are based off of the current US dollar-to-cryptocurrency exchange rates as per Coinbase the day you look up your item(s) in our online database. The US Dollar-to-cryptocurrency exchange rates change daily due to currency fluctuations in value. If you choose to get paid with crypto-currencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum or Litecoin), then, the actual amount of Bitcoin, Ethereum or Litecoin that you receive will either be the amount that you were quoted when you placed your order or it will be a new amount based off of the current Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin market prices and current US dollar-to-cryptocurrency exchange rate the day that we send your payment to you.

Crypto-currency market values change daily and their US Dollar (USD) equivalency/conversion/exchange rates change daily as well. If you choose to receive your payment in crypto-currency, then, the actual amount of crypto-currency that you receive will either be the amount that you are quoted when you place your order or it will be different than the quote/estimate that you were given when you placed your order due to fluctuations in crypto-currency market values and their US Dollar conversion/equivalency/exchange rates. The amount of crypto-currency that you receive will either be the amount that you were quoted when you placed your order or it will be a different amount based on the current market values of crypto-currencies and the US Dollar-to-cryptocurrency conversion/exchange rates the day that we send your payment to you. We do currency conversions based off of Coinbase’s cryptocurrency market prices and US dollar-to-cryptocurrency equivalency/exchange rates.
